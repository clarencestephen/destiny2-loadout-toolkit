# Darth Bot

A Destiny 2 chatbot for the DARTH_BANKAI Discord — answers in the brand voice, draws on your real vault, and isn't allergic to specifics.

> *"The dark side has better frame rates."*

---

## What it does

| Question | How it answers |
|---|---|
| *"How do I get Crimson catalyst?"* | KB lookup on light.gg + manifest description + live search for current quest steps. |
| *"Good PvP build with my current weapons?"* | Pulls your **real inventory** from `destiny-voyager/user_config.json` and recommends based on what you actually own. |
| *"Summarize Salvation's Edge encounters."* | KB lookup on destinypedia / scraped raid guides. |
| *"Easiest solo ops map?"* | Live Brave search — meta changes weekly. |
| *"Why do I keep dying?"* | Asks ONE clarifying follow-up instead of guessing. |
| *"Is there an all black shader?"* | Manifest fuzzy lookup + live search. |
| *"How do I jump better?"* | KB on class-specific jump mechanics. |
| *"What should I do next?"* | Inventory-aware advisory — looks at what you have unlocked, what's tagged. |

Everything but the ChromaDB embeddings runs locally. No data leaves your machine unless you opt into Brave Search.

---

## Setup

### 1. Install ollama and pull the model

```bash
# https://ollama.com/download (one binary)
ollama pull qwen3:8b
ollama serve   # runs at http://localhost:11434
```

### 2. Install Python deps

```bash
cd darth-bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Create a Discord bot

Same flow as the other bots in this repo:
1. https://discord.com/developers/applications → New Application → name it "Darth Bot"
2. Bot tab → Reset Token → copy
3. OAuth2 → URL Generator → scopes `bot` + `applications.commands`
4. Bot Permissions: `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, `Use Slash Commands`, `Embed Links`
5. Invite to your server with the generated URL

### 4. Set env vars

Append to `/home/cs/.env`:
```bash
DARTH_BOT_DISCORD_TOKEN=<your_bot_token>
# DISCORD_GUILD_ID is already set to your server
BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY=<optional — sign up at api.search.brave.com for 2k free/mo>
```

Mirror in `/mnt/a/master_secrets.md` per your secrets workflow.

### 5. Populate the knowledge base (one-time, ~15-30 min)

```bash
# Scrape ~100 light.gg pages, ~100 top reddit posts, 9 raid wiki pages
python3 -m darth-bot.kb.scrape --source all

# Chunk + embed into chromadb (~5 min)
python3 -m darth-bot.kb.embed
```

Both are re-runnable. The scraper is polite (1.2s between requests) — let it cook.

The Bungie manifest is already cached by `destiny-voyager/decode_dim.py`, so the bot uses that directly with no extra setup.

### 6. Bootstrap the meta_state (current Destiny 2 state — anti-drift)

Scraped KB content goes stale (a Reddit raid guide from Feb 2026 still
says "Light level ≥ 1230" even though Edge of Fate squished max power
to 550). The bot grounds on `darth-bot/data/meta_state.json`, which is
injected into every LLM call as authoritative truth — KB content that
contradicts it is ignored.

```bash
# Pull current week's Nightfall from Bungie API + bootstrap baseline
python3 -m darth-bot.meta_state --refresh

# Just print the state without refreshing
python3 -m darth-bot.meta_state
```

Hand-edit `darth-bot/data/meta_state.json` to fill `pvp_meta` and
`pve_meta` (top weapons by mode) — those don't have a live source yet
and need manual curation when the meta shifts.

### 7. Run it

```bash
python3 -m darth-bot.bot
```

In Discord:
- `/sanity` — verify ollama + kb + inventory are reachable
- `/ask <question>` — any Destiny question
- `/build <activity>` — uses your inventory
- `/raid <name>` — encounter rundown
- `/catalyst <weapon>` — quest steps
- `@Darth Bot <question>` — mention from any allowed channel

---

## Channels it answers in

Restricted to: `destiny-voyager`, `smugglers-cache`, `engineering-bay`, `trooper-comms`, `the-cantina`, `lfg-storyline`, `lfg-raids`, `lfg-dungeons`. Edit `ALLOWED_CHANNEL_NAMES` in `config.py` to expand.

---

## Weekly refresh (anti-drift cadence)

The Destiny 2 meta shifts every Tuesday at reset. `refresh_weekly.sh`
runs the three things that keep the bot current:

1. Re-scrapes the KB (`kb.scrape --source all`)
2. Re-embeds into chromadb (`kb.embed`)
3. Refreshes `meta_state.json` from Bungie API (`meta_state --refresh`)

Run manually:

```bash
bash darth-bot/refresh_weekly.sh
```

Or schedule via crontab — runs Tuesdays at 9:30pm UTC (post-reset):

```cron
30 21 * * 2  cd "/home/cs/workspace/Destiny 2/destiny2-loadout-toolkit" && bash darth-bot/refresh_weekly.sh
```

Add it with `crontab -e`. Logs land in `darth-bot/data/refresh-logs/`,
last 4 weeks retained.

**Automatically refreshed by `refresh_weekly.sh`:**

- `recent_patches` — pulled from Bungie's RSS feed
  (https://www.bungie.net/en/Rss/News) by `darth-bot.twab_scraper`.
  Captures TWIDs (This Week In Destiny), patch notes ("Destiny 2
  Update 9.5.6.3"), and season launches. Each item is categorized as
  `twid` / `patch` / `season` / `news` so the LLM can filter relevance.
- `this_week.nightfall` — pulled from Bungie API milestones endpoint.

**Still needs manual updates** during the weekly refresh:

- `meta_state.json` → `pvp_meta.top_primaries/top_specials/top_heavies`
- `meta_state.json` → `pve_meta.*`

These come from light.gg's meta page and destinytracker.com's usage
stats. A future enhancement: build scrapers for those sources so the
weekly script fully automates.
