darth-bot/kb/scrape_raid_sources.py
===================================
Targeted multi-source scraper for raid + dungeon encounter detail.

SOURCE HIERARCHY (most-trusted → least-trusted):
  1. AUTHORITATIVE — mechanics + facts (use as source of truth):
     • blueberries.gg     — structured encounter guides
     • help.bungie.net    — official mechanics + bug acknowledgments
     • destinypedia       — already scraped separately; edited wiki
  2. SUPPLEMENTAL — cheese, variations, edge cases (cite, don't trust blindly):
     • r/raidsecrets      — community spreadsheets, peer-vetted cheese
                            (only fetched, tagged 'supplemental', NEVER used
                            to settle a mechanics dispute)

EXPLICITLY DROPPED:
  • r/DestinyTheGame — popularity-driven, complaints/memes, low signal
  • Any source ranked purely by upvotes without peer-review process

When sources conflict on mechanics, AUTHORITATIVE wins. Supplemental gets
documented as a permutation only if multiple authoritative sources are silent.

Output: data/scrape/<source>/<activity_slug>/<doc>.md with frontmatter.

Run:
    python3 -m darth_bot.kb.scrape_raid_sources
